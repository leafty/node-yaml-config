# node-yaml-config

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leafty/node-yaml-config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leafty/node-yaml-config)

Write your configuration files for node.js in yaml

## Installation

```bash
npm install node-yaml-config
```

## Usage

```js
var yaml_config = require('node-yaml-config');

var config = yaml_config.load(__dirname + '/config/config.yml');

console.log(config); 
```

## Configuration Files

In your configuration file:

```yaml
default:
  server:
    host: 'localhost'
    port: 3000
  database:
    host: 'localhost'
    port: 27017
development:
  database:
    db: 'dev_db'
test:
  database:
    db: 'test_db'
production:
  server:
    host: $OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP
    port: 8000
  database:
    db: 'prod_db'
    user: 'dbuser'
    password: 'pass'
  cache:
    dir: 'static'
```

**node-yaml-config** takes the configuration found in default, then overwrites it with the values found in the environment specific parts. The configuration file is loaded synchronously.

Values prefixed with a dollar sign will be substituted with the corresponding environment variable.

## API

### load(filename[, env])

Load the configuration found in `filename` with the environment based on `NODE_ENV`. The environment can be forced with the `env` argument.

**node-yaml-config** keeps parsed yaml files in memory to avoid reading files again.

### reload(filename)

Reload the configuration found in `filename`. Later calls to `load` will show the new configuration.

The file is loaded synchronously.
